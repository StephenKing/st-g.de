As I recently gave two talks at the _AWS Community Day - Bay Area_ as well as _DENOG_12, where I explained how we implemented two of our recent projects at EMnify,
I was intervied in the [EMnify blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAypNBSGQpw).

If you are interested in my other talks, see the [Speaking](/speaking.md) page. Happy watching!
